Yevamot
Chapter 1
Could a man's brother from a father side marry his half sister from mother's side?  If the brother dies, she is an ervah but not in the list of 15?

What did I mean here:

{"idea":"The obligation to peform yibum falls only on brothers who share a father. A man's half sisters from a mother's side is considered an ervah.", 
"source": "Yevamot 1:1"},

Just to confirm, if one of the brothers has an ervah among the co-wives but the others do not, then they are not all free.  Someone has to do chalitzah or Yibum, right?



Chapter 2

-  Is a man prevented from marrying the sister of someone with whom he once had a zikuk bond?  
-  Can a man marry the sister of someone with whom he did chalitzah? How about if the woman with whom he had a chalitzah is now dead?
-  If two brothers have a zikuk bond with a woman and one performs chalitzah with her, can the second brother marry that woman's sister while she is still alive? I think Yevamot 2:7 says yes because the third brother is marrying. 

-  If an agent testifies that he saw a get signed and written overseas, we know he may not marry the divorcee.  But if they marry are they forced to divorce?

Chapter 3
-  Does the zikuk bond have to be simultaneous for the prohibition to kick in or can you have a temp zikuk with one and then a temp zikuk with the other to enact the prohibition?
-  Why are the brothers forced to divorce the sisters in 3:1 if the zikuk bond has already been broken?  
-  One sister is an ervah to one brother in 3:2, so he can marry the other.  Why cant the other brother now marry the remaining sister since the zikuk bond has been broken?
-  Here we are assuming all the marriages were biblical right?
- Woah is the man who sends off which wife?  The woman with whom he did maamar and her sister. 

-  What is you have 3 bros, 2 married to 2 sisters, and one to a stranger.  One of the sister's husbands dies.  The 3rd bro does maamar with the sister.  He dies.  The first brother is not
fully bound to his ervah, so is the stranger woman the co-wife of an ervah?  I think no. Agreed in part 2 of 3:6

-  when a woman falls to a man for yibum but is an ervah, do all of her future co-wives become forbidden to that man?

-  In the case where a woman falls to two brothers, one does maamar and dies before yibum, the last brother must to chalitzah with her and her co-wife. If she had multiple co-wives, does he do chalitzah with her and ONE OF the co-wives?

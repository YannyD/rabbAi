[{"question":"what trade do you teach your son?",
"answer":"I put aside every trade in the world, and I teach him only Torah. The benefits of Torah learning come in this world, but also the principal remains in the world to come. Other professions are not like this. When a person becomes sick and cannot do their profession, they starve and die. Torah protects you from all harm in your youth, gives reward and hope in his old age.",

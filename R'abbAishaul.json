[{"question": "What are shetukim",
"answer": "Shetukim can also be called Bedukim, since we must ask the mother about the status of the child's father. If the mother says he was not a disqualified person, then the child is not a mamzer. A child only has the status of a shetuki if the mother is not available to ask or she does not know who the father is.",

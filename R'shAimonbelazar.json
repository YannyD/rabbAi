[{"question":"How do we know that wealth and poverty are based on merit?",
"answer": "Have you ever seen a beast or a bird that has a trade? And yet they are sustained without effort. But they were created only to serve me, while I was created to serve my Master. Is it not logical that I should be sustained without effort? I only work a trade because I have corrupted my deeds and lost my sustenance.",

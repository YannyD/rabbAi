{"question": "A man's wife goes overseas with the husband of his wife's sister, and they are told that both died. They decide to remarry one another, but later both return alive. Are they permitted to return to their marriages?",
"answer": "We know that a woman who learns she had mistakenly remarried recieves a get from her second husband and thus cannot return to her first, because it looks like she returns to him after divorcing another. In this case, the woman will not recieve a get because their marriage was never originally permitted. Thus she can return to her first husband, and he can return to his first wife. Had the man originally only been engaged to his wife, he would be forced to give her sister a get, she could not return to her first husband, and he could not return to his first wife.",

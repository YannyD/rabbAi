[{"question":"If a woman becomes betrothed to a man after hearing testimony that her first husband died, but he comes back alive, what is her status?",
"answer": "Based on Leviticus 21:7, she is still eligible to marry a kohen. She returns to her husband and does not need a get from the man she betrothed. Even if he gives her a get, the verse gives us reason to rule that a diqualified divorcee must have been divorced from a legitimate marriage, which this was not.",
